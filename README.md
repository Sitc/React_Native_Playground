# React_Native_Playground

I have creaated this repository to try and compare react native to other solutions.
If you are interested in testing it or build something on top of it, here is a little guindiance how to run it.

## Initial Setup

1. clone or download/open React_Native_Playground folder
2. run "sudo npm install expo-cli --global"
3. run "npm install"

4. if you don't have xCode or Android studio to run Virtual machine you can run it on you phone

## If you run it on you phone

1. Download Expo on your device [https://expo.io/learn]
2. #### Preview your project
   Open Expo Client on your device. Scan the QR code printed by expo start with Expo Client (Android) or Camera (iOS). 
   You may have to wait a minute while your project bundles and loads for the first time.
   
## If you run it on Virtual machine,

### and have Xcode installed you can run --> "npm run ios"

#### A few tips:

If something goes wrong, just Command + Q the simulator and click on Run on iOS Simulator again.
Go to Hardware > Device to change the device.
Do Command + right arrow or left arrow to switch between portrait and landscape.
Command + 1 and 2 will make the simulator Physical size (smaller) or Pixel accurate respectively. 
You can also resize the device by mouse hovering the corners of the device.
